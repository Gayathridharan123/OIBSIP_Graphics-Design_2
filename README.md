Project: "Shadow Core" Logo Design
Hey everyone! This is a logo I made for a made-up brand called "Shadow Core." I wanted to practice creating a logo that has a certain feeling or mood.

Objective:
My main goal was to design a logo that looks mysterious, elegant, and a little bit cosmic. I wanted to capture the idea of light and dark, which is why I chose the name "Shadow Core."

Steps:

Idea: I started with the concept of a moon and stars to give it that spacey, mystical vibe.

Visuals: I found a great picture of the moon that shows both the lit-up side and the shadow, which fits the brand name perfectly.

Typography: I picked a soft, flowing cursive font to make it feel elegant and less aggressive than a bold font would.

Tools Used:
I used a graphic design tool like Canva or Photoshop to combine the image and the text.

Outcome:
I think the final logo turned out really well. It gives off the exact feeling I was going forâ€”a mix of mystery, beauty, and elegance.
